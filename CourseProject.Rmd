## Introduction

This is the presentation of the Developing Data Products. 

Here, I will give a brief introduction to my Shiny app, based on K-Means 
clustering of a quasirandom dataset.

The link to the shiny app is: https://k9martin.shinyapps.io/K-Means/

The link to the github repository where this job is: https://github.com/k9martin/ProjectDDataProduct


## K-Means Clustering

This technique consist on assign one center (the closest) to any point in a given dataset. 

K centers are initialized randomly. At the end of the algorithm, this centers will be displayed 
minimizing the total distance between points and centers, assigning one center to every point.

## Shiny App

In my Shiny app, user can choose how many centers will be (1 to 9), and my app automatically 
calculates this centers. Also, position of the centers will be displayed. 

``` {r echo=FALSE, out.width = '85%'}
fig_path <- file.path(getwd(),"AppImage.png")
knitr::include_graphics(fig_path)
```
